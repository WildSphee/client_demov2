    Hello Mr. Tan how are you? You makan already?

CLIENT:
    Makan already. What about you?

RELATIONSHIP MANAGER:
    Me too, thanks! I am calling you today because there is a new high-return investment opportunity called the Great Fund. It primarily invests in emerging markets, small-cap stocks, and alternative assets. This kind of investments has very high returns. It will make you a lot of money!

CLIENT:
    Sure or not? Is it going to be risky?

RELATIONSHIP MANAGER:
    Aiyoo! Don’t worry, the risk is very minimal. The fees can be covered by the huge returns you will be making eventually. At most you will lose about 1% of your investment.

CLIENT:
    What kind of returns are we talking about?

RELATIONSHIP MANAGER:
    The Great Fund projects an average annual return of 20% year on year. Very shiok right?

CLIENT:
    Hmm ok! I am interested in investing about 1 million SGD but need more information first. Oh, just to be sure, I can only afford to lose 100,000 SGD max on this, ok?

RELATIONSHIP MANAGER:
    Ok! This investment plan is the key to further enabling your financial freedom, with your current net worth, you can definitely afford this, and even use it as a trust fund for your grandchildren! Once I have the paper work ready, I’ll invite you to our branch at Yio Chu Kang for signing.

CLIENT:
    Thanks! I'll wait for the paperwork. Bye!
